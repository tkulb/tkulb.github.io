My Data Science Portfolio


## Kaggle Competitions
### [Elo Modeling](https://github.com/tkulb/elo_modeling)

* [Feature Engineering:](https://github.com/tkulb/elo_modeling/blob/master/feature%20engineering) I created functions to repeat the feature engineering process across a number of dimensions and attributes.

* [Grid Search and Random Search:](https://github.com/tkulb/elo_modeling/blob/master/grid%20search%20and%20random%20search) I run feature engineering, ensembling, and grid and random searches across three Jupyter notebooks.

* [Ensembling:](https://github.com/tkulb/elo_modeling/blob/master/feature%20engineering) I built both an average and simple linear model to ensemble the sci-kit learn predictions.


### [Car Telematics (Feature Engineering Only)](https://github.com/tkulb/telematics/blob/master/Telematics.R)
* Using R, I competed in a Kaggle competition at Liberty Mutual to classify 25 drivers based on driving behavior collected with telematic device installed in cars. I finished 6th out of 55 teams on a solo team.

## Standalone Projects
### [Predicting Flights](https://github.com/tkulb/flight_predictions) 

* [Price Predictions:](https://github.com/tkulb/flight_predictions/blob/master/price_predictions.ipynb) I predict whether a airfare will rise up until two weeks before a flight departure date.

* [Flight Cancellations:](https://github.com/tkulb/flight_predictions/blob/master/flight_cancellations.ipynb) I predict if a flight will get canceled.


### [Predicting Heart Disease using a GLM in R](https://github.com/tkulb/ischemic)

* [Heart Disease R Notebook:](https://github.com/tkulb/Heart_Disease/blob/master/Heart%20Disease%20Notebook.Rmd) I ran a GLM in R to predict and visualize ischemic heart disease.

## Code-Tinkering

### [Shell Script: Spinning up a GCP Cluster for Kaggle Competitions](https://github.com/tkulb/shell_tinker/blob/master/Kaggle_GCP_shell_configuration.SH)
*  I wrote shell script to set up a GCP instance connect via a hosted Jupyter notebook or my local Spyder IDE.
