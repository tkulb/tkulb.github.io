### [Predicting Flights:](https://github.com/tkulb/flight_predictions) 

[Price Predictions](https://github.com/tkulb/flight_predictions/blob/master/price_predictions.ipynb)

[Flight Cancellations](https://github.com/tkulb/flight_predictions/blob/master/flight_cancellations.ipynb)



Across two separate flight projects I predict:
a. whether a airfare will rise up until two weeks before a flight departure date.
b. if a flight will get canceled.



### [Predicting Heart Disease using a GLM in R:](https://github.com/tkulb/ischemic)

[Heart Disease R Notebook](https://github.com/tkulb/Heart_Disease/blob/master/Heart%20Disease%20Notebook.Rmd)

I ran a GLM in R to predict and visualize ischemic heart disease.
